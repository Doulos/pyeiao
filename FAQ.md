## nbtutor doesn't display anything

nbtutor doesn't display anything. When clicking on *toggle*, it says:
"No visualization data found for this cell"

This issue often happens at the first install, or when re-installing nbtutor.
This is possibly a nbtutor issue. <br/>
The following work-around seems to help:
- first reload the page from your browser. Confirm you want to leave the page.
- restart the jupyter notebook
- make sure to re-run the cell loading the nbtutor extension.
- from now on, nbtutor should work fine (*toggle* if necessary).
